# bloons
George is messing around with LibGDX and would eventually like to make Bloons Tower Defense.

To run the "game", just run DesktopLauncher.

I'm currently reading up on examples from https://www.gamefromscratch.com/page/LibGDX-Tutorial-series.aspx, which is a little dated but otherwise fine.

# bloons
George is messing around with LibGDX and would eventually like to make Bloons Tower Defense, the browser/mobile game from Ninja Kiwi.

To run the "game", just run DesktopLauncher.

I'm currently reading up on examples from https://www.gamefromscratch.com/page/LibGDX-Tutorial-series.aspx, which is a little dated but otherwise fine.
I'm using https://www.iloveimg.com/crop-image/crop-png since Microsoft paint doesn't seem to let me crop with a transparent background.


Ideas that are not yet implemented that I would like to implement:

- Instructions screen

- Sound control

- Spell cards (ultimate attacks) for towers that have a separate cooldown
-- This sounds hard but would be really cool
